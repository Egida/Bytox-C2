# Bytox-C2
Bytox is a framework that allows you to use Discord as a command and control centre. It is built mainly on the Discord.py module and also has some C# and C++
incorporated into it's source code. The C2 allows a user to generate a python payload and in the future a C++ payload which will allow them to have control and access to a system. 

**Version 1 has been released. This includes all the python features in the script. C++ aspects are coming very soon**

This is a PoC program, do NOT use this for malicious purposes.

## [Setting up main.py]

firstly, you will need to have a Discord bot set up and get it's token. You can do this at the Discord Developer Portal. Secondly, you will need to run the `Builder.py` script this will install the correct python modules and also build Bytox-C2 for you. All you need to do is follow what it is asking for on screen.

There is a manual way of setting up the script if you would prefer and you can find this in the README.txt file in the repo.
