# Bytox-C2 -COMING SOON
Bytox is a framework that allows you to use Discord as a command and control centre. It is built mainly on the Discord.py module and also has some C# and C++
incorporated into it's source code. The C2 allows a user to generate a python payload and in the future a C++ payload which will allow them to have control and access to a system. 

**Version 1.0 to be released very soon, this will include the python side of Bytox. C++ side is still in development**

## [Setting up main.py]

To set up main.py it is very simple. All you need is a Discord account, a Discord Bot and python installed onto your PC. Once you have these follow tese instructions:

    - Ensure you have Discord.py installed on your system. Run the installer to ensure you have the necessary packages installed on your host machine
    - Copy your bot token and replace line 16 with your token
    - Create a Discord server and a notification channel, also ensure you have Discord Developer Mode on as you will need the channel ID
    - Copy the notification channel ID and then replace line 17 with the new channel ID
    - Inviet your bot the server. Here you can run the main.py script and Bytox should come online and send a message to your notification channels
    - Here you can now type !help and help commands will appear on how to use this framework
